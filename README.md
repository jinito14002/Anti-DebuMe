# Anti-DebugMe
An Interactive Anti-Debugger checker for Reverse Engineers.  
The purpose is to be able to recognize Windows anti-debug techniques inside x86 assembly for beginners and intermediate malware analysts.  
Many of the techniques can be bypassed by tools such as ScyllaHide, but it is important to understand how it works on a code level.  
When I started learning Malware Analysis, there were many (not so great) text-based explanations of anti-debug techniques, and only a few had actual source code or assembly examples.
To make things worse, many of the them were scattered across the web. (or maybe I was just bad at using Google...)  
I made this because its one of the more interesting aspects of reversing malware, and because I wish I had something like this when I started out.
The goal of this project is to aggregate those sources and provide a hands-on guidance through explanations and actually debugging each check.

This is by no means a list of ALL anti-debug techniques, but I will add as much as I can.
